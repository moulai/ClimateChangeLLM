# ClimateChangeLLM
## Project Overview
The ClimateChangeLLM project is dedicated to developing an AI-powered dialogue robot that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLM) specifically for the domain of climate change.

## Objective
Our primary goal is to provide users with an accurate, reliable, and user-friendly information retrieval platform that supports education and decision-making in the field of climate change.

## Data Integration
We aim to integrate authoritative climate change materials, including reports, academic papers, and news articles, to ensure the platform offers comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge.

## User Engagement
The end product will be designed with a focus on facilitating user engagement, making complex climate data accessible and understandable to a wide audience, and encouraging informed discussions on climate change topics.

## Future Development
The project will also consider potential expansions and updates to maintain relevance and usefulness in the rapidly evolving field of climate change research and policy.

If feasible, the project will explore the integration of automated processes for the acquisition, filtering, assessment, and database inclusion of the latest relevant materials.
